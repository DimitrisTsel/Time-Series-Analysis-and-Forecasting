# DBLP XML Parser for Computational Linguistics Publications and Time Series Analysis

This Python script combines two main functionalities:

## 1. DBLP XML Parser
The initial section of the script is dedicated to parsing a large XML file from the DBLP (Digital Bibliography & Library Project) database. The goal is to extract information about publications related to the field of Computational Linguistics and count the number of publications by year. Here's a brief overview of this part:

- **Input XML File**: The path to the DBLP XML file is specified in the `file` variable.
- **Keywords**: Keywords related to Computational Linguistics are predefined to identify relevant publications.
- **Parsing Logic**: The script iterates through each line of the XML file, searches for publication titles, checks for relevant keywords, and extracts publication years.
- **Output**: The script prints the count of publications for each year and optionally writes this information to a text file (`dblp_data.txt`).

## 2. Time Series Analysis
The second part of the script focuses on time series analysis of the number of publications in Computational Linguistics. Here's a summary of this analysis:

- **Dependencies**: Various Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, and Seaborn are imported.
- **Data Loading**: The script loads the publication data from the `dblp_data.txt` file into a Pandas DataFrame and preprocesses it.
- **Data Visualization**: It visualizes the number of publications over time using Matplotlib.
- **Stationarity Check**: The script checks the stationarity of the time series using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.
- **Decomposition**: It decomposes the time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals components.
- **Transformation**: The script applies a logarithmic transformation to the time series to stabilize variance.
- **Modeling**: It fits Holt-Winters and ARIMA models to the transformed time series data.
- **Model Evaluation**: The script evaluates the performance of the models using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
- **Forecasting**: Finally, the script makes predictions for future values of the time series using the fitted models.

## Usage
1. **DBLP XML Parser**: Ensure the correct file path is specified in the `file` variable.
2. **Time Series Analysis**: Make sure the `dblp_data.txt` file is generated by the parser section.
3. **Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries if not already installed.
4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in a Python environment.

This script provides a comprehensive analysis of publications in the field of Computational Linguistics and offers insights into the trend and forecast of publication numbers.
